## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)**<sup><a href="#source1">[1]</a></sup> to interpret a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**<sup><a href="#source1=2">[2]</a></sup> trained for brain tumor classification. The goal is to visualize which regions of the input image the model focuses on when making predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process.

While CNNs can achieve high accuracy, our work demonstrates that **even seemingly strong models may lack a true understanding of the input data.** Using **AI explainability techniques** like Grad-CAM provide critical insights into a model's decision-making process to **make AI more transparent and understandable.**

## Key Features
- **CNN Model**: A custom CNN trained on brain tumor MRI images.<sup><a href="#source3">[3]</a></sup> While we use our own architecture, Grad-CAM is compatible with any keras CNN.
- **Grad-CAM**: Visualizes model attention and highlights regions contributing to predictions.
- **Results**: Includes interpretable heatmaps that reveal whether the model focuses relevant regions or irrelevant artifacts.

## Requirements
See the full list in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Results
Here are some example Grad-CAM heatmaps generated by our model:
